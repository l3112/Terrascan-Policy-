# Terrascan-Policy-
Wanting feedback on how this is supposed to be formatted. The code it's referring to is not uploaded, but can be sent privately.

I am asking important questions, such as
- Are both of them the policies, but with different languages?
- How can I get my Terrascan to acknowledge it?
- What's with these errors of 'no directories found for path', 'failed to initialized OPA policy engine' (even after running terrascan and terraform init)?
- Code generated by RegoEditor in VS Code.
